rewrite-dependabot-commit.sh takes no arguments: it amends HEAD in place.
It is meant to be run by `git rebase --exec` in dependabot-rewrite.yml.

# Rewrite Dependabot's own commits and nothing else. Skipping rather than
# failing keeps the workflow green when `synchronize` replays it over a branch
# this script already rewrote (those commits are re-authored, so they no longer
# match) -- and stops a re-run from force-pushing a fresh SHA every time.
